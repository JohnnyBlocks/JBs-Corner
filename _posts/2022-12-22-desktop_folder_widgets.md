## Matrix Inspired

I'm using a [Matrix boot animation](https://steamdeckrepo.com/post/PBVwP/the_matrix_intro_by_knightmd) from [KnightMD](https://steamdeckrepo.com/user/71) so I decided to theme my desktop experience to match.  This is my current desktop setup.

### Hide Desktop Icons

I like a clean desktop.  I don't care for icons on my desktop.  It looks cluttery.   I access files via the file manager and not from clicking on the desktop.  It's just another folder to me.

1. Right Click on the Desktop
2. Select 'Configure Desktop and Wallpaper...'
3. Change Layout from 'Folder' to 'Desktop'
4. Click 'OK' or 'Apply'
Note: This is where you can change your wallpaper as well.

## Desktop Widgets

There are many desktop widgets for the Steam Deck.  It's Arch Linux running KDU and it brought the widgets with.  Visualiztions for memory, processor, storage utilization, KDE Connect (connect your phone to your Steam Deck), and so many others.

## Add Binary Clock

I like the [Binary Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_clock).  While I wont actually use it to tell time, I like the aethetic.

1. Right click on the desktop and lect '+ add widgets...'

## Add Fuzzy Clock

I also like [Fuzzy Clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic) so I added it to my Task Bar.  I even added it twice to get two values at different accuracy levels.

1. Right click on the decktop and lect '+ add widgets...'

2. Filter the list by typing 'Fuzzy' into the search box.
3. Click on the Fuzzy Clock Widget and it will be added to your Task Bar.
4. If you want two then click it again.
